# HTML/JS/SASS Boilerplate using Gulp.

Basic boilerplate using the above technologies.

Run ````npm install```` to install dependencies.
Run ````gulp```` to start local server on localhost:3000 and then ````gulp build```` to create dist folder when ready for deployment.

Assembled from a variety of articles and tutorials.
Joel Longie's Gulp tutorial was the most useful (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmdT2zhFmn4).
